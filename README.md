<h2>📖 The Story Behind the Project</h2>

<p>
After completing my first unguided analytics project, I was ready for something bigger — something that challenged me to think deeper and work smarter.  
That’s when I discovered the <b>Malven Market</b> dataset.
</p>

<p>
What began as a simple retail dataset quickly turned into an <b>intermediate-level analytical challenge</b>.  
Without any tutorials or guidance, I decided to dive in headfirst — determined to transform plain numbers into insights that could drive real business decisions.
</p>

<p>
Armed with <b>Power BI</b>, I took on the responsibility of understanding customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales patterns — all on my own.  
This project was not just about creating visuals; it was about learning to think like an analyst.
