# ðŸ›’ Malven Market: My Intermediate-Level Unguided Data Analytics Project

As I progressed in my data analytics journey, the **Malven Market** project marked a significant milestone as my **second unguided project**. This intermediate-level endeavor challenged me to apply my growing skills to a more complex dataset, sourced from the **WsCube Tech** channel.

Using **Power BI** as my primary tool, I delved into analyzing data from the Malven Market industry. The project allowed me to uncover sales trends, identify top-performing products, and understand customer behavior across various regions. Without any direct guidance, I embraced the challenge of transforming raw data into a visually compelling and insightful dashboard.

The experience enabled me to:

- Refine my data processing skills.
- Enhance my ability to create impactful visualizations.
- Develop a keen understanding of business analytics.

Through this project, I discovered valuable insights such as:

- The most profitable product categories.
- Regional sales performance trends.
- Customer purchasing patterns.

This project not only reinforced my confidence in using **Power BI** but also strengthened my ability to independently derive actionable insights. **Malven Market** was a pivotal step in my journey, bridging the gap between beginner-level projects and more advanced analytical challenges.
